#     retrieve a batch of dominoes and their target order given the value of each dominoe

#     dominoes are paired values (combinations with replacement) of integers
#     from 0 to <highestDominoe>. The total value of each dominoe is the sum of
#     the two integers associated with that dominoe. For example, the dominoe
#     (7|3) has value 10.

#     Each element in the batch contains an input and target. The input is
#     composed of a sequence of dominoes in a random order, transformed into a
#     simple representation (explained below). The target is a list of the order
#     of dominoes by the one with the highest value to the one with the lowest
#     value. Note that many dominoes share the same value, but since the dominoe
#     list is always the same, equal value dominoes will always be sorted in the
#     same way.

#     Each element can have a different sequence length, they will be padded
#     with zeros to whatever the longest sequence is. The ignoreIndex is used to
#     determine what to label targets for any padded elements (i.e. any place
#     where no prediction is needed). The nll_loss function then accepts this as
#     an input to ignore. This is part of the reason why pointer networks are
#     awesome... the input and output can vary in size!!!

#     The simple representation is a two-hot vector where the first
#     <highestDominoe+1> elements represent the first value of the dominoe, and
#     the second <highestDominoe+1> elements represent the second value of the
