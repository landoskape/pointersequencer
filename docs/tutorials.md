# Documentation: Tutorials and Basic Usage
This section of the documentation provides examples of standard usage for this
repository. It is useful for anyone looking for instructions for how to run
dominoes games, create or load agents, analyze ELO scores, and print 
results and updates about gameplay and agent policy. 

For more examples on how to perform experiments and analyses, see the
[experiments](../experiments) folder, which contains python scripts with fully
fledged programs. The readme file in the experiments folder contains a table 
of contents explaining what each experiment does. 


## Standard Imports
The code depends on several modules written in this repository. To try all the
code examples below, first run the following import statements: 
```
from dominoes import leagueManager as lm
from dominoes import gameplay as dg
from dominoes import agents as da
from dominoes import utils
```

## Creating a league, running a game, updating ELO scores
Start by creating a league. Specify which set of dominoes to use (e.g. the
highest dominoe and the number of players per game). 
```
# Start by creating a league
highestDominoe = 9 # Choose what the highest dominoe value is (usually 9 or 12)
numPlayers = 4 # Choose how many players per game
league = lm.leagueManager(highestDominoe, numPlayers, shuffleAgents=True)
```

Add agents by class type (see leagueManager documentation for a full
explanation of how to add agents to a league):
```
league.addAgentType(da.bestLineAgent)
league.addAgentType(da.doubleAgent)
league.addAgentType(da.greedyAgent)
league.addAgentType(da.dominoeAgent)
league.addAgentType(da.stupidAgent)
```

Create a gameplay object from the league to specify which players will play
against each other and to operate the gameplay. Play the game and print the 
results.
```
game, leagueIndex = league.createGame()
game.playGame()
game.printResults()
```

Finally, return the results to the league manager to update ELO scores. Note: 
thank you to [Tom Kerrigan](http://www.tckerrigan.com/Misc/Multiplayer_Elo/) 
for an efficient method for multiplayer ELO. 
```
league.updateElo(leagueIndex, game.currentScore)
```

## Adding a trained agent to the league manager
If you have trained an agent and saved the agents parameters, then you can 
instantiate the agent, load its parameters, and add the agent to a league. 
```
parameterFile = r'/path/to/parameterFile.npy'
lineValueAgent = da.lineValueAgent(numPlayers, highestDominoe, league.dominoes, league.numDominoes, device=league.device)
lineValueAgent.loadAgentParameters(parameterFile)
lineValueAgent.setLearning(False) # For testing the agent, set learning to False
league.addAgent(lineValueAgent)
```

## Running a game and showing the results: 
Start by creating a game object using the default agent type. Then, play game
with a specified number of rounds. Usually, the number of rounds is equal to 
the highest dominoe plus 1 (e.g. for 9s, play from 0-9). But for training or 
statistics purposes, it is useful to set rounds to a high number.
```
highestDominoe = 9
numPlayers = 4
game = dg.dominoeGame(highestDominoe, numPlayers=numPlayers) 
game.playGame(rounds=3) # Play the game 
```

Show the scores for each round: 
```
game.printResults()

# output: 
Scores for each round:
[[14 35  0 19]
 [ 8 17  0  7]
 [ 0  9  7  1]]

Final score:
[22 61  7 27]

The winner is agent: 2 with a score of 7, they went out in 2/3 rounds.
```

Then, you can display a record of the events in the gameplay with the
following lines: 
```
utils.gameSequenceToString(game.dominoes, game.lineSequence, game.linePlayDirection, player=None, playNumber=None, labelLines=True)
utils.gameSequenceToString(game.dominoes, game.dummySequence, game.dummyPlayDirection, player=None, playNumber=None, labelLines=True) 

output:
player 0:  [' 4|8 ', ' 8|2 ', ' 2|9 ', ' 9|9 ', ' 9|5 ', ' 5|5 ', ' 5|0 ', ' 0|4 ', ' 4|1 ', ' 1|2 ', ' 2|0 ', ' 0|1 ']
player 1:  [' 4|7 ', ' 7|7 ', ' 7|5 ', ' 5|6 ', ' 6|1 ', ' 1|9 ', ' 9|8 ', ' 8|8 ', ' 8|1 ', ' 1|3 ', ' 3|4 ']
player 2:  [' 4|6 ', ' 6|3 ', ' 3|5 ', ' 5|1 ']
player 3:  [' 4|9 ', ' 9|6 ', ' 6|6 ', ' 6|8 ', ' 8|5 ', ' 5|2 ', ' 2|6 ', ' 6|7 ', ' 7|0 ', ' 0|0 ', ' 0|6 ']
dummy:  [' 4|2 ', ' 2|3 ', ' 3|8 ', ' 8|0 ', ' 0|9 ', ' 9|3 ', ' 3|7 ', ' 7|9 ']
```

Or, for a more verbose output, set `player` and `playNumber` as follows. This 
appends the player index and the play number to each dominoe listed, which is 
a lot of text to look at, but contains all the information needed to 
understand what happened each game. 
```
utils.gameSequenceToString(game.dominoes, game.lineSequence, game.linePlayDirection, player=game.linePlayer, playNumber=game.linePlayNumber, labelLines=True)
utils.gameSequenceToString(game.dominoes, game.dummySequence, game.dummyPlayDirection, player=game.dummyPlayer, playNumber=game.dummyPlayNumber, labelLines=True) 
```
